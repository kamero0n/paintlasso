gmtk game jam 2025!

made by ~ Cameron Gomez, Earl Tizon, Karl Tizon

concept ~ imagine if a clever, but socially awkward girl found a wand that let her get out of weird situations... so solve some "puzzles" and get out of the social situations!!

learnings (from cam):

- art is tough w/ love 2d: replacing a lot of my temp art was a battle and unfortunately due to time and constraints of the engine being a bit tricky, we were unable to add it. i think in the future, if i had to use Love2D again, I would possibly get in art as soon as possible when it's ready -- this helps w/ testing and making sure it'll appear nicely. i'd probably organize like: player sprite, object sprites, npc sprites, background tileset. or i would just make the sprites super duper simple...

- time & scope: time usually kills me for game jams. this time, i took TOO long setting up the levels and while i don't think that's bad, it just didn't allow me time to get to SFX and art as quickly as I would've liked. I should've scoped a lot smaller to make it puzzles that you can solve quickly and would be easier to program.

this felt like the most important to me this time around for a game jam ~ gonna keep learning and improving to be the best I can be! (~ cam)
